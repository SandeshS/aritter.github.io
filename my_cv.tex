\section{\sc Research Interests}
%Much of humanity's collective knowledge is encoded in ever expanding volumes of text. Broadly I am interested in getting computers to understand natural language at scale, and new applications this will enable. 
%I enjoy working with large quantities of text which is not restricted to a narrow domain, such as that found on the {\bf Web} or in {\bf Social Media}.

\section{\sc Research Projects}

{\bf Information Extraction in Social Media}
Off-the shelf tools such as Part of Speech Taggers and Named Entity Recognizers perform poorly when applied to Social Media text due to its noisy and unique style. To address this I have been working towards building a set of Twitter-specific text processing tools [EMNLP 2011a].  Users of Social Media sites frequently discuss events which will occur in the future. By annotating Named Entities and resolving temporal expressions (for example ``next Friday''), we are able to automatically extract a calendar of popular events occurring in the near future from Twitter [KDD 2012].

{\bf Conversational Modeling in Social Media}
I have worked on unsupervised modeling of dialogue acts in Twitter [NAACL 2010]. By remaining agnostic about the set of classes, we are able to learn a model which provides insight into the nature of communication in a new medium.  I have investigated the feasibility of automatically replying to status messages by adapting techniques from Statistical Machine Translation [EMNLP 2011b], using millions of naturally occurring Twitter conversations as parallel text. Although there are many differences between conversation and translation, with a few conversation-specific adaptations we are able to build response models which often generate appropriate replies to Twitter status posts. This work has several possible applications, including conversationally aware predictive text entry.

{\bf Latent Variable Models of Lexical Semantics}
I have applied a variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to automatically infer the argument types or Selectional Preferences of textual relations [ACL 2010].  Our model of selectional preferences is useful in filtering improper applications of inference rules in context, showing a substantial improvement over a state-of-the-art rule-filtering system which makes use of a predefined set of classes.  In addition, I have applied latent variable models to automatically induce an appropriate set of categories for events mentioned on Twitter [KDD 2012].  By leveraging large quantities of unlabeled data we are able to outperform a supervised baseline at the task of categorizing events extracted from Twitter.  I have also investigated an approach to Distant Supervision using Topic Models.  As a distant source of supervision we make use of lexical entries from Freebase, a large, open-domain database, to generate constraints in the model. This approach leverages the ambiguous supervision provided by Freebase in a principled way, significantly outperforming Co-Training on a weakly supervised named entity classification task [EMNLP 2011a].
