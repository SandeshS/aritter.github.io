This is a simple task if you can read English well.
<p>

  You will be shown a text passage from a news article or social media (a message) in addition to a candidate entity and asked whether to, decide whether it justifies editing the Wikipedia infobox attribute of a named entity to a specified new value.  You will be asked to make a simple 3-way decision (Yes / No / Not Sure).  You don't need to check the Wikipedia page for the associated entity, simply assume that a page exists and it does not yet contain the associated attribute/value pair.
<p>
  
<b>As an example</b>, the message:<br>
"Congratulations to Dilma Rousse, first female President of Brazil ! This is epic !"
<p>
  
Will change the "leader" attribute of "Brazil" to the new value "Dilma Rousse", however the following message will not:<br>
"Brazil's Rousseff confirms banker Levy as finance minister"<br>
because it does not indicate a recent change of Brazil's president.
<p>

<b>Here is another example</b>:<br>
"Chris Paul signed to the Clippers yesterday , and we already have Chris Paul merchandise at my store lol we move fast ."
<p>
  
This will change the "current team" attribute of "Chris Paul" to the new value "Clippers", however the following message will not:<br>
"Clippers need to get Chris Paul some help he can't do it by hisself"
because it does not indicate a recent change of Chris Paul's current team.

Your judgments will be used by researchers worldwide to help advance research on Computational Linguistics.  Participation is voluntary and  you are free to complete as much or as little work as you choose.  You are free to stop participating at any point.  A computer program will compare your answers against a native English speaker and other peopleâ€™s answers.  It is OK to have different answers from other people and make some mistakes; however if you make too many mistakes we will have to rejected your answers.  You will be payed US $0.20 per hit you complete. After the study is complete, we will retain your judgments on the data, but replace your Mechanical Turk IDs with anonymized versions.  This research is being funded by the National Science Foundation and conducted at Ohio State.  If you have any questions or concerns about the study, please contact me (Alan Ritter) at ritter.1492@osu.edu.
