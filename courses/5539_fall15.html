	  <p>
	    Encyclopedic knowledge bases (KBs) such as Wikipedia and Freebase form the underlying intelligence behind Google’s Knowledge Graph, Facebook’s Graph Search, IBM’s Watson and more.  These broad-coverage databases contain facts about entities, for example a person’s employer or a city’s mayor.  While today’s KBs have good coverage for popular entities, little structured information is available for less prominent entities, suggesting the need for information extraction from large unstructured and semi-structured data sources found on the Web.
	    
	  <p>
	    The course will involve reading and discussing recent papers from top conferences in the field. Students will propose and complete an open-ended course project; example projects might include anything from extracting relations from HTML tables on the web to event extraction from news or social media text.

	  <p>
	    Previous experience with natural language processing and/or machine learning will be very helpful.

    <p>
      Grading will be based on 2 components:

      <h4>50% participation</h4>

      The class will read and discuss two papers each week.
      Before class, each student should read the assigned paper and write a short critique (between 100-200 words).  These
      reviews should not be simple summaries, but discuss positive aspects of the paper and limitations, or suggestions for how the work could be improved or extended, 
      or raise questions regarding which points were difficult to understand so we can discuss in class.
      The point of writing reviews is to help spark discussions in class.
      Students are allowed to skip 2 reviews throughout the semester.
      Reviews should be submitted to a course discussion forum for the paper in <a href='https://carmen.osu.edu/'>Carmen</a> before 9am on the day of class.  
      Please email your reviews to the instructor if there are any technical issues with online submission.

      <br><br>
      Each student will also lead discussion of two papers.
      The discussion leader should the main contributions of the paper within about 15 minutes after which the class will open up for discussion.
      Please email a your presentation materials (slides or discussion notes) to the instructor for review 24 hours before class.
      Students leading the discussion of a paper do not need to write a review for that paper.

      <ul class="list-group">
	<li class="list-group-item">20% Paper Summaries</li>
	<li class="list-group-item">20% Paper Presentation</li>
	<li class="list-group-item">10% Participation in Class Discussions</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>50% course project</h4>

      Students will propose and carry out a mini research project with guidance from the instructor.  The project should produce a 4-5 page report including experimental results
      comparing against some baseline.
      Students will give a short in-class presentation  on their project at the end of the semester.
      Projects can be done individually or in groups of 2 or 3 students.
      The scope of the project should be appropriate to the size of the group, and all students in a group will receive the same grade.
      Students will submit an initial 1-2 page project proposal by 10/8
      which will be reviewed by the instructor who will provide feedback.
      Students are encouraged to meet with the instructor to discuss project ideas.
      It is OK for multiple groups of students to work on similar projects, though they are encouraged
      to communicate, share data and focus on different aspects.  If you are currently working on a research project in a related area, feel free to discuss
      with the instructor about using that as a course project.  I am also open to the possibility of literature-reviews or other types of projects, however
      empirical projects which evaluate performance using metrics such as precision and recall and compare against an appropriate baseline system are preferred.

      <br>
      Please submit your project report, source code and data to the dropbox on Carmen by 12/12.
