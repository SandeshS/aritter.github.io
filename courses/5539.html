    <h1>CSE 5539: NLP and IE for the Social Web</h1>


<p>
    The recent explosion of user generated content in online social media presents a wealth of new opportunities for data analytics applications. Structured data is just the tip of the iceberg; most of this data is locked up as unstructured text, which is difficult for current algorithms to process.  There has been growing interest in adapting natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction (IE) technology to this data, as well as identifying new opportunities for applications on big, noisy, informal text data.  Examples include computational social science, user modeling, personalization, news recommendation, event detection and more.</p>

<p>
The course will involve reading and discussing recent papers from top conferences in the field.  Students will propose and complete an open-ended course project; example projects might include anything from extracting a concert calendar from Twitter to automatically generating answers to health questions in online patient forums. </p>

<p>
While the course will cover some technical material, emphasis will be on applications and building systems rather than mathematical details.  Some prior coursework in Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning will be very helpful.</p>

  <div class="panel-heading">Grading</div>

  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>
      Grading will be based on 2 components:

      <h4>50% participation</h4>

      The class will read and discuss two papers each week.
      Before class, each student should read the assigned paper and write a short critique (about half a page).  These
      reviews should not be simple summaries, but discuss positive aspects of the paper and limitations, or suggestions for how the work could be improved or extended.
      The idea is that writing reviews will help to spark discussion in class.
      Students are allowed to skip 2 reviews throughout the semester.
      Reviews should be submitted to a course discussion forum for the paper in <a href='https://carmen.osu.edu/'>Carmen</a> before 9am on the day of class.  
      Please email your reviews to the instructor if there are any technical issues with submission.

      <br><br>
      Each student will also lead discussion for one paper.  <b> email the instructor before class on 8/29 to reserve a presentation slot.</b>
      The discussion leader should the main contributions of the paper within about 15 minutes after which the class will open up for discussion.
      Please email a your presentation materials (slides or discussion notes) to the instructor for review 24 hours before class.
      Students leading the discussion of a paper do not need to write a review for that paper.

      <ul class="list-group">
	<li class="list-group-item">25% Paper Summaries</li>
	<li class="list-group-item">15% Paper Presentation</li>
	<li class="list-group-item">10% Participation in Class Discussions</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>50% course project</h4>

      Students will propose and carry out a mini research project with guidance from the instructor.  The project should produce a 4-5 page report and students will give a
      short in-class presentation  on their project at the end of the semester.  Projects should be done in small groups of about 2 or 3 students.  The scope of the project
      should be appropriate to the size of the group, and all students in a group will receive the same grade.  Students should submit an initial 1-2 page project proposal by 9/26
      which will be reviewed by the instructor who will provide feedback.  Students are encouraged to meet with the instructor to discuss project ideas.
      Students are free to choose from the sample projects, or propose their own.  It is OK for multiple groups of students to work on the same project, though they are encouraged
      to communicate, share data and focus on different aspects.  If you are currently working on a research project in a related area, feel free to discuss
      with the instructor about using that as a course project.  I am open to the possibility of literature-reviews or other types of projects, however empirical projects which evaluate
      performance using metrics such as precision and recall are preferred.

      <br>
      Please submit your project report, source code and data to the dropbox on Carmen by 12/5.
