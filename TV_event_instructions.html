These are the detailed instructions for the Amazon Mechanical Turk HIT.
<p>
You will be presented with a tweet with certain information present in it and asked whether an event is going to happen based solely on the content of the tweet. You will then be asked to make a decision (Definitely Yes/ Probably Yes/ Ambiguous/ Probably No/ Definitely No). You are to assume nothing about these events or use your own knowledge about these events to answer the question. The answer must be based solely on the <b>content of the tweet</b>.
</p><p>
  
<b>Here is an example</b>:<br>
"CBS Poll: Trump poised for landslide win over establishment in South Carolina - Breitbart"
</p><p>
  
Question: Is Trump going to win the elections in South Carolina?
Based on just the data present in the tweet, it definitely looks like Trump has the numbers to win in South Carolina. So the tweet has significant data for the reader to make a decision about the question being asked.
</p><p>

<b>Here is another example</b>:<br>
"NFL Mock Draft 2012: Matt Kalil an apparent lock for Minnesota Vikings: 2 pick in the NFL Draft"
</p><p>
  
This tweet suggests that there is a very high chance that the player 'Matt Kalil' would get drafted to the Minnesota Vikings. However, the tweet -
"Vikings may not take Kalil in the 1st Rd of NFL Draft. CB Morris Claiborne may now be the guy, who scored a record low of 4 on Wonderlic Test"
suggests the opposite - that he might not get picked. Based on the text, you need to decide whether the event is going to happen or not.

Your judgments will be used by researchers worldwide to help advance research on Computational Linguistics.  Participation is voluntary and  you are free to complete as much or as little work as you choose.  You are free to stop participating at any point.  A computer program will compare your answers against a native English speaker and other peopleâ€™s answers.  It is OK to have different answers from other people and make some mistakes; however if you make too many mistakes we will have to reject your answers.  You will be paid US $0.20 per hit you complete. After the study is complete, we will retain your judgments on the data, but replace your Mechanical Turk IDs with anonymized versions.  This research is being funded by the National Science Foundation and conducted at Ohio State.  If you have any questions or concerns about the study, please contact me (Alan Ritter) at ritter.1492@osu.edu.
